# Vuforia-Demo
This is a Unity project that I created to play with Vuforia, an AR library that simplifies target detection.

Basically, this app detects an elicorn image and replacing that with a 3D Citus Cluster animation.

<img src="elicorn.jpg" alt="The Elicorn Target" style="width: 480px;"/>

To be able to use this project, you need Unity 2017.2 with Vuforia support installed.

Here is a short YouTube video demonstrating the app:
